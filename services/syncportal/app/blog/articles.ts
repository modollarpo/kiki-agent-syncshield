    content: `Outcome-as-a-Service (OaaS) is fundamentally changing how brands pay for marketing. Instead of flat fees and vague promises, OaaS aligns incentives: you only pay when you profit.\n\nTraditional agencies optimize for billable hours and spend, not outcomes. KIKI Agent™ uses SyncTwin™ simulations to validate every campaign before launch, ensuring only profitable strategies go live.\n\nKey advantages:\n- No wasted spend: Only high-LTV customers targeted\n- Pre-launch validation: SyncTwin™ blocks unprofitable campaigns\n- Real-time rollback: SyncShield™ auto-pauses underperforming creatives\n- Transparent attribution: SyncLedger™ tracks Net Profit Uplift\n\nWith OaaS, the risk shifts from client to provider. KIKI only earns when you do.\n\nWant to see your unclaimed revenue? Try the ROI Calculator in the dashboard.`,

    content: `SyncTwin™ is KIKI Agent’s digital insurance engine. Before any campaign launches, SyncTwin™ runs thousands of simulations using historical data and projected market conditions.\n\nIf the simulation predicts negative Net Profit Uplift, the campaign is auto-rejected. This protects both the client and KIKI’s 20% OaaS fee.\n\nHow it works:\n1. SyncBrain™ generates a strategy\n2. SyncTwin™ simulates outcomes (market shocks, conversion drops, API outages)\n3. Only campaigns with ConfidenceScore > 0.85 are approved\n4. SyncShield™ monitors live performance and triggers rollback if deviation >15%\n\nThis system ensures every dollar spent is mathematically justified.`,
